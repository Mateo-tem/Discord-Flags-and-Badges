# Discord Flags & Badges

Flags, badges, and information provided by Discord and Discord Developer Documentation.

Some flags are represented with badges in the Discord Client, in this repository you can see information about these flags and their respective badges in **SVG** and **PNG** (5000 x 5000 pixels) files.

These badge images are obtained through Discord Assets.

> Here you can see the lists of User and Application flags that represent badges:

**Something you need to know:** Some flags (in the case of `VERIFIED_BOT` and `SYSTEM`) do not represent a badge, instead they represent an indicator of what the user is. The images of the flags (mockups) are only available in PNG format with 5000 x 1926 pixels and 7102 x 1926 pixels respectively.
